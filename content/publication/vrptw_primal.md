abstract = "The aim of the paper is to solve exactly a new variant of the vehicle routing problem with time windows which includes synchronization visits. A new formulation is proposed and solved using boosting methods. We propose some dedicated primal heuristics and node feasibility checks. The results compared to a previous formulation and to a standard solver show the efficiency of this type of combination."
