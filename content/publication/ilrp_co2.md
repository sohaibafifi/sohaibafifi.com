abstract = "This paper considers an integrated Inventory Location Routing problem ILRP which consists of optimizing the operating costs, risks and routingâ€˜s CO2 emissions related to a Hazmat supply chain. The goal is to determine: the location of a set of capacitated depots to open, customers allocated to them, quantities delivered from these depots to customers per period, and the sequence in which customers are served by a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles. To solve the problem, an exact bi-objective model is designed and tested for small and medium size instances. A case study is proposed to prove industrial practicality of the model. The results show that the proposed solution resolves decently the medium size instances."
